# CS-255-System-Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project walks through the system design process for a client named DriverPass, who wanted to provide students with better access to driving training. They recognized that many students were failing driving tests because they had no way to practice. 
They wanted to design a system that student drivers can schedule in-person driving reservations with trained drivers, and have access to online courses/tests where they can practice the written portion of the driving test.


## What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a good job interpreting the needs of the client and users. For this project, we were only given a transcript of a meeting that was a few pages long. I think I also did a good job of making the UML diagrams. I know they are not perfect, much like this entire project. But I feel confident I did my best at my current stage of learning.


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the entire project if I could. System design is an iterative process with the client and is always evolving. But if I had to pick one document, I would revise the DriverPass Business Requirements Document. 
I would get more information from the client and understand what they want. That would help me add to each section with more detail.


## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by thinking about how they will use the system. A useful thought to think is, if I were using this system, how would I want it to work? It is paramount to consider the user when designing because they are the ones actually using the system. 
If you make a system without considering users' needs, it will likely not be a very good system. A UML use case diagram is super useful for this because it helps show what each actor in the system needs to be able to do. If each actor can easily perform their actions/use cases, then the purpose of the system is fulfilled.


## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by being methodical and trying to understand how the system will all fit together. For example, how will that user use that process, how will that system interact with that system, and so on? It is very helpful for me to understand how all the pieces work together. That may be a lot harder to do in a very large system, but I was able to do it with this project. In the future, I will continue to use UML diagramming and try to gather as many requirements as possible from the users and the client.
